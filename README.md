This repository contains a Tcl procedure that has a bug related to counting words in a string. The procedure `count_words` fails to accurately count words when multiple spaces occur between words.  The `bug.tcl` file demonstrates the incorrect behavior and the `bugSolution.tcl` file provides a corrected version.
